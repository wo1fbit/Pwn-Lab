## Rev
1. Reading List 

I created this binary to keep track of some strings that I want to read. I thought I put a CTF flag in it so I'll remember to make a problem for UTCTF, but I can't seem to find it...

2. Game

Nostalgic overload, at least for me. Credit due to Carolina.

3. UTCTF Adventure ROM 5 

I found this mysterious cartridge at the Nintendo headquarters, I think it might be some sort of prototype, can you find out how to beat the game?

Note: The flag appears in non-standard notation, in the form ```"UTFLAG ABCDEFGH"```

4. Looks Correct to Me 

the flag checker looks right to me

oh I guess it doesn't terminate if your flag is right

5. Welcome

Note: while this challenge is nominally RE, there is some crypto-level/crypto-style math involved too.

Welcome to UTCTF! I made a special last minute program just for you to display a wonderful welcome message (+ flag!) I may have accidentally (okay... purposely) made a small bug in my math that makes this unsolvable(TM). Can you figure it out and fix it for me please?
